<h1>About me</h1>

<!--p class="baseline">Not intended for reading by normal people. Extremely geeky conversations I usually only have with myself when I've been working too much and lack sleep. I put them here so I can disagree with myself when I finally get some sleep and remind myself I should never talk about work when going out. But really, my goal is to create a web application using the knowledge I have accumulated over the years.</p>

<p>I have tons of unfinished personal projects, ranging from web servers, compilers, to web applications, but every single one of them had a <em>purpose, and a quite important one indeed.</em> Even though they never resulted in a finished project, I learned most of what I know today in the process. They gave me the freedom to explore new, experimental technologies and ideas without having to worry about deadlines and the restrictions of so-called stable, proven, production-ready environments.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean I lack professional experience. I've been freelancing for over 5 years and have landed gigs for some very prestigious companies... but frustratingly, I can't take credit for a big portion of my work for legal reasons. I hope these kind words will make up for it.</p-->

<blockquote><p><span class="open">“</span>Stephan is great to work with. He brings deep technical expertise to the table, combined with an aestethic and business sense that make him a tremendous person to have on any team. What's more, he is super-motivated. We created a full website based on ruby/rails with complex authentications, fancy front-end and deployed in production in a record time, which was very impressive. One of the best people I worked with, and I hope to work with Stephan in the future if in any way possible.<span class="close">”</span></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="open">“</span>Stephan is a superb Flash and Flex developer. Working independently from France with the team based mostly in NYC and San Francisco, Stephan has helped us build our first several iterations of our embeddable Flash player, which has allowed us to move our internet radio listening to Facebook, blogs and other third‐party platforms. In addition, Stephan was integral in setting up our Flash playback using HTML controls on the flagship website, taking advantage of an external application called SoundManager.</p>
<p>Stephan is dependable and talented, and I'd strongly recommend him.<span class="close">”</span></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="open">“</span>I had the pleasure of working with Stephan on a project over the Christmas holidays here in LA. At times, we had team members in LA, Shanghai, New York &amp; Paris, but Stephan was always on top of his game and available almost round the clock. Our deadline was near impossible, but with Mr. Florquin on the job, we delivered an amazing product. I will continue to champion this developer's skills for the rest of my days online.<span class="close">”</span></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><span class="open">“</span>Stephan Florquin travaille très proprement, possède une excellente sensibilité visuelle et un sens de l'ergonomie, lui permettant d'anticiper la demande du graphiste. Il aurait pu faire une excellente carrière en indépendant, quel dommage qu'il décide de se sédentariser.<span class="close">”</span></p></blockquote>
